## 🔧 Customizations by Me

I've modified and enhanced the original practice code to add personal touches and improve interactivity.  
Here are some of the customizations I made:

- ✨ **CSS Animations** – Smooth transitions and animations for better visual experience
- 🖱️ **Custom Mouse Cursor** – Replaced the default cursor with a creative, dynamic cursor using JavaScript and CSS
- 🌈 **Visual Effects** – Added hover effects, button animations, and other UI enhancements
- 🧠 **Interactive JavaScript Elements** – Used JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior
